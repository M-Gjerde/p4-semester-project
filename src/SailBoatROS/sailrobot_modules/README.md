The Sailrobot_modules package has all the optional package used with the sailrobot.
It contains the Camera Color Detection algorithm, AIS decoding using a RTL-SDR device...  
These modules cam be used without the Sailboat.

# Nodes
## Camera Nodes
### camera_dist
Gives a distance to an object detected by color. The distance is given depending on the known size of the object.

## AIS Nodes
### rtl_sdr_connect
This node connects to a RTL-SDR device and publishes the NMEA strings

### ais_parser
This node parses the NMEA data

### ais_decode
This node decodes the NMEA data and publishes custom ROS AIS_messages from the sailrobot_custom_msg

## Calypso Nodes
This node is to be used with ultrasonic wind sensors that use BLE (Bluetooth). It was made for Calypso Instrument ultrasonic wind sensor, but should be compatible with any ultrasonic wind sensors using BLE.

## XBee_Communication Nodes
These nodes are to be used to control the boat using XBees.
